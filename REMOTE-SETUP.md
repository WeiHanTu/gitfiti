# Remote-Only Daily Commits Setup

## âœ… Remote Setup Complete!

Your automated daily commits are now configured to run **remotely only** on GitHub's servers.

## How It Works

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml`
- **Schedule**: Daily at 10:00 PM UTC (6:00 PM EST)
- **Runs on**: GitHub's servers (not your local machine)
- **Manual trigger**: Available in GitHub Actions tab

### What Happens Daily
1. GitHub Actions automatically runs the workflow
2. Creates a commit with current timestamp
3. Pushes to your repository: https://github.com/WeiHanTu/gitfiti.git
4. Updates your GitHub contribution graph

## Benefits of Remote Setup

âœ… **No local machine required** - Runs on GitHub's servers  
âœ… **Always reliable** - No dependency on your computer being on  
âœ… **Free** - GitHub Actions provides 2000 minutes/month free  
âœ… **Automatic** - No manual intervention needed  
âœ… **Secure** - Uses GitHub's secure environment
